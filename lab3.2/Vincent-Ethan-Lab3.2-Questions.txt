Assume the CPU executes kgetc() in main();
Draw a diagram to show the control flow of the CPU when a KBD key is pressed.
    
    [starting from kgetc() in main, in loop awaiting key press]
    => kbd button pressed
    => [vector table.0x18]      WHY? (this is the index in the table which corresponds to software irq handler)
    => irq_handler:             WHY? (we have been directed here from the vector table)
    => IRQ_chandler()           WHY? (invoked from irq_handler:)
    => kbd_handler()            WHY? (vicstatus indicates interrupt was a kbd input)
    => (collapses back to kgetc() in main, where IRQ interrupts get masked out)
